        <P> Whistleblower Protection System

                This project is a web-based platform designed to support and protect whistleblowers by allowing them to report unethical or illegal activities anonymously and securely. The system uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the user interface, with PHP and a database (such as MySQL) for back-end processing and data storage. Key features include user registration, secure login, encrypted report submission, and admin access for case review. The goal is to create a safe digital environment that promotes transparency and accountability.
